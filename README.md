The program include implementation of Neville's method, Newton's forward method, divided difference method, and cubic spline interpolation.
Polynomial interpolation is the interpolation of a given data set by the polynomial of lowest possible degree that passes through the points of the dataset.
This helps us approximate points on complicated curves.
